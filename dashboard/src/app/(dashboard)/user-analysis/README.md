# User Analysis

## Overview
Analyzes Reddit user profiles for competitive intelligence and creator identification. Provides quality scoring (0-10 scale), OnlyFans creator detection, and posting pattern analysis to understand competitor strategies and discover high-performing creators for market research and collaboration opportunities.

**Core Features**: User quality scoring algorithm (5-factor), bio analysis with URL extraction, cross-subreddit activity mapping, engagement tracking, creator identification badges.

## TODO List
- [ ] Improve quality score algorithm for better creator identification accuracy
- [ ] Build advanced competitor analysis dashboard with performance tracking
- [ ] Add creator collaboration opportunity scoring for partnership identification
- [ ] Implement market trend analysis from creator behavior patterns
- [ ] Create content strategy insights showing optimal content types per creator
- [ ] Add engagement rate tracking for monitoring creator performance over time
- [ ] Build comprehensive creator success pattern analysis

## Current Errors
- Quality score calculation needs refinement for creator identification accuracy
- Bio URL extraction may miss OnlyFans links with non-standard formats
- Cross-subreddit analysis doesn't account for content type variations
- Limited historical data for new accounts affects quality scoring accuracy
- Missing validation for duplicate user entries with different casing

## Potential Improvements
- Advanced creator scoring with machine learning for successful creator identification
- Real-time competitor analysis dashboard tracking top creators' strategies
- Intelligent collaboration scoring system to identify partnership opportunities
- Enhanced market trend analysis with predictive modeling for emerging behaviors
- Content strategy optimization showing which content types work best per creator
- Automated engagement rate monitoring with alerts for performance changes

## Technical Notes
