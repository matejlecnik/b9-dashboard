## Technical Implementation Notes

### Server-Side Filter Fix (2025-01-13)
**Problem**: Client-side filtering on paginated data caused incorrect results
- Only 30 items loaded at a time
- Category filter applied to loaded subset, not full dataset
- Result: "Age Demographics" showed 0 when none in first 30 items

**Solution**: Moved filtering to Supabase query
```typescript
// Category filter now in query
if (selectedCategories.length === 0) {
  query = query.or('category_text.is.null,category_text.eq.')
} else if (selectedCategories.length < availableCategories.length) {
  query = query.in('category_text', selectedCategories)
}
```

**Result**: Accurate filtering across all 1045 subreddits

### Technical Specifications
- **Data Source**: `subreddits` table where `review = 'Ok'` (excludes user feeds with `name LIKE 'u_%'`)
- **Total Count**: 1045 subreddits (1053 Ok - 8 user feeds)
- **Categories**: 17 total categories with server-side filtering
- **Pagination**: 30 items per page with infinite scroll
- **Performance**: <200ms response with server-side filtering
